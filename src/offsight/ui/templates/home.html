<h1>OffSight™ - Regulatory Intelligence</h1>
<p><small>Prototype system for monitoring and analysing UK offshore wind regulatory changes.</small></p>

<div class="explanation-box">
    <strong>What this system does:</strong>
    OffSight monitors configured regulatory sources, stores versioned documents, detects changes between versions,
    and uses a local AI model (Ollama) to generate short summaries and impact categories. Human reviewers validate
    or correct these suggestions to create an auditable decision trail.

    <h2>End-to-end workflow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sources are configured on the <strong>Sources</strong> page.</li>
        <li>Scraper jobs fetch HTML content and store versioned documents.</li>
        <li>Change detection compares versions and creates <em>RegulationChange</em> records.</li>
        <li>AI summarisation runs locally via Ollama to suggest a summary and impact category.</li>
        <li>Humans review each change on the <strong>Changes</strong> page and record validation decisions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Use the navigation links above to explore the system:
        start with <strong>Sources</strong> to see what is monitored, then review detected changes on
        the <strong>Changes</strong> page.

<h1>OffSight™ - Regulatory Intelligence</h1>
<p><small>Prototype system for monitoring and analysing regulatory changes in UK offshore wind guidance.</small></p>

<div class="explanation-box">
    <strong>What this system does:</strong>
    OffSight monitors configured regulatory sources, stores versioned documents, detects changes between versions,
    and uses a local AI model (Ollama) to summarise the impact of those changes. Human reviewers then validate
    or correct the AI suggestions so you have an auditable view of what changed and why it matters.

    <h2>End-to-end workflow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sources are scraped and stored as versioned regulatory documents.</li>
        <li>Change detection compares versions and creates <em>RegulationChange</em> records with diffs.</li>
        <li>AI generates a short summary and impact category for each change.</li>
        <li>Humans approve, correct, or reject suggestions, creating a validation trail.</li>

        Use the navigation links above to configure <strong>Sources</strong> and review detected
        <strong>Changes</strong>. This UI is intentionally minimal and optimised for the exam demo.
